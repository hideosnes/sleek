# sleek
## sleek is a todo app based on todo.txt, free and open-source
sleek offers a clean and simple interface that can be used with mouse and keyboard, keyboard only or touch devices. Using the <a href="https://github.com/todotxt/todo.txt">concept of todo.txt</a>, an easy to understand but powerful syntax to create todos, you can add contexts to your todos or assign them to projects you're working on. Priorities can be set and if you add due dates and recurrences, sleek will send you notifications just in time.

All that can be done typing plain text or guided by sleeks interface that for instance will show suggestions on contexts and projects while typing, offers pickers to ease the selection of due dates or set recurrence intervals.

There is no cloud integration, but as sleek writes your todos into a plain text file, you can put it anywhere and sync it to all your devices. That also means if you don't have sleek at hand or if you don't like it any more you can just edit the todo.txt file with any text editor or other todo.txt application.
